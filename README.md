# SumPrefixMPI
This project was developed for module II of AA (Algoritmi Avanzati) @ Alma Mater Studiorum - UniBo - Universit√† degli studi di Bologna.
The project goal is to find the prefix sums of an array, in a distributed system. To split or to gather the work/local prefix sums among the different host/node we had to use the MPI libraries.
